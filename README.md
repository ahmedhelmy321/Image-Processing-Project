ðŸ“· Image Processing GUI Application using Python and CustomTkinter
âœ… Project Description:
This project is a comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) application for image processing, built using Python and the customtkinter library. It allows users to upload images and apply a wide range of image processing operations interactively and visually.

ðŸ§© Key Features:
Interactive GUI:

Designed with customtkinter for a clean and modern look.

User-friendly interface to load images, display results, and visualize histograms.

Point Operations:

Pixel-wise operations including Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Complement.

Users can apply mathematical changes to pixel values directly.

Color Image Processing:

Modify the red channel intensity.

Swap color channels (e.g., Red â†” Blue).

Remove red channel for specific visual effects.

Histogram Operations:

Histogram Stretching to enhance contrast.

Histogram Equalization to improve brightness and dynamic range.

Neighborhood Processing:

Linear filters like Mean Filter.

Non-linear filters like Median Filter to reduce noise.

Image Restoration:

Simulate and remove noise:

Salt & Pepper Noise

Gaussian Noise

Apply filters to restore image clarity.

Image Segmentation:

Apply Thresholding techniques:

Global Thresholding

Adaptive Thresholding

Otsu's Method

Edge Detection:

Detect edges using the Sobel Operator.

Mathematical Morphology:

Perform operations like Dilation, Erosion, Opening, and Boundary Extraction.

Focused on binary image processing.

Image and Histogram Display:

View original and processed images side by side.

Plot and analyze histograms using matplotlib.
